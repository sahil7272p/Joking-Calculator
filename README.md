# 🤣 Joking Calculator

## 🚀 Project Overview

Introducing the **Joking Calculator** — a fun and interactive web calculator that not only performs basic arithmetic operations like ➕ addition, ➖ subtraction, ✖️ multiplication, and ➗ division, but also delivers a **random joke** every time you hit the “=”. Whether you get the answer right or wrong, you’ll always get a laugh! 😄

This project is great for learning **JavaScript DOM manipulation**, integrating humor APIs or custom joke scripts, and creating a lighthearted UI.
